🎙️ Jarvis – AI Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant that listens to your voice commands, performs everyday tasks, and can even respond intelligently using OpenAI’s GPT models. Inspired by popular assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, Jarvis is designed to be lightweight, customizable, and extendable.

🚀 Features

Voice Activation: Wake Jarvis by saying its name and give commands hands-free.

Web Automation: Opens Google, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other sites.

Music Playback: Plays your favorite songs from a pre-built musicLibrary.

News Headlines: Fetches and speaks the latest headlines from NewsAPI.

AI Chat Integration: Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 to respond to general queries with short, helpful answers.

Speech Output: Dual modes for voice response:

pyttsx3 (offline, text-to-speech)

gTTS + pygame (realistic voice playback)

Error Handling: Gracefully handles recognition and runtime errors.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3

speechrecognition – Convert speech to text

pyttsx3 / gTTS + pygame – Text-to-speech playback

webbrowser – Open websites

requests – Fetch news data

OpenAI API – AI-driven responses

Custom musicLibrary – Play songs via links

⚙️ How It Works

Jarvis listens through the microphone for the wake word "Jarvis".

Once activated, it records your next command.

If the command matches a task (open a site, play music, fetch news), it executes it.

Otherwise, it forwards the query to OpenAI GPT, gets a response, and speaks it aloud.

📌 Next Steps / Improvements

Add weather, reminders, or calendar integration.

Improve wake-word detection with pocketsphinx.

Build a GUI for desktop users.

Connect with IoT devices for smart home control.
